                <h5><strong>Question:</strong> When should you use nodejs and when should you use mongodb?</h5>
                <p>
                    <strong>Answer: </strong>
                    <br />  Node.js is fast, lightweight and efficient. It uses the asynchronous mode of operation, event-driven Input/Output rather than using the traditional threads or separate threads for each process. Node.js is suited for applications that have a lot of concurrent connections and each request as it were needs exceptionally few CPU cycles, since the event loop (with all the other clients) is blocked amid execution of a function.
                    <br />
                    <br /><strong>On the other hand,</strong> MongoDB is a document database, also called a document-oriented database or a document store.
                    MongoDB are a suitable when-
                    <ul>
                        <li>your data is document-centric and doesnâ€™t fit well into the schema of a relational database</li>
                        <li>you need to accommodate massive scale</li>
                        <li>you are rapidly prototyping, and a few other use cases</li>
                        <li>you need to integrating large amounts of diverse data</li>
                        <li>you need to delivering data in high-performance applications</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
